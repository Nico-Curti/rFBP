Python Installation
===================

Python version supported : |Python version|

The easiest way to install the package is using `pip`

.. code-block:: bash

	python -m pip install ReplicatedFocusingBeliefPropagation

.. warning::

	The setup file requires the `Cython` and `Numpy` packages, thus make sure to pre-install them!
	We are working on some workarounds to solve this issue.

The `Python` installation can be performed with or without the `C++` installation.
The `Python` installation is always executed using `setup.py`_ script.

If you have already built the `rFBP` `C++` library the installation is performed faster and the `Cython` wrap was already built using the `-DPYWRAP` definition.
Otherwise the full list of dependencies is build.

In both cases the installation steps are

.. code-block:: bash

	python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt

to install the prerequisites and then

.. code-block:: bash

	python setup.py install

or for installing in development mode:

.. code-block:: bash

	python setup.py develop --user

.. warning::

	The current installation via pip has no requirements about the version of `setuptools` package.
	If the already installed version of `setuptools` is `>= 50.*` you can find some troubles during the installation of our package (ref. issue_).
	We suggest to temporary downgrade the `setuptools` version to `49.3.0` to workaround this `setuptools` issue.
